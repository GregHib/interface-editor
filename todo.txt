// Thoughts
//----------------------
Save types: 317 regular (cache sprites), 317 adapted (external sprite handling)... other revisions
How to detect revision of cache attempted to be loaded? Xaves

// Features
//----------------------
Fixed mac drag image offset different from windows
Fix sprite sizes when dropped (e.g internal sprite 0)
Fix hash named dragged sprites invisible (.value mismatch?)
Support for when there are no sprites (cache/external not loaded yet)
No canvas/features, for when no cache loaded.
Canvas background
Improve sprite support (will need support for 667 and osrs in the future so make sure the current external/internal sprite systems are children of the same parent)
Improve how properties are handled, support for disabling set ones depending on type, hidden (not on panel), capped values (instead of how currently handled, make a custom ObjectProperty wrapper which contains both properties?), and categories (ofc) - make a PropertyFactory
Array of colours to replace with transparency in settings
Replace sprite colours in the image in sprite tabs
Support/improve support for transparency colour palette (see money pouch glow sprites)
Key press to navigate sprites lists
Move sprites list to right panel?
Editable widget names
Widgets within widgets; recursive for hierarchy + memento's; cutting/pasting etc..
Hold shift to lock movement on one axis?

//Optimisation
Test performance without listeners
Test performance without memento's & action recording
Test performance with unlimited heap memory
Better way to handle group changes than one at a time?


// Tidy up
//----------------------
Sprite naming; cache sprites, external sprites, internal sprites - consistency.
Arrow key movement in edit controller
Expand marquee out to it's own class with inheritance, so you can switch out marquee type/shape etc..


// Improvements
//----------------------
Resize with shift = aspect ratio
Support for multiple attributes on a row e.g https://gyazo.com/fb3f3a596c270d886fe116ac7188cd56 https://gyazo.com/d17ac37a4aee18625f0037c36aba52d5
The way the edit mode outline is refreshed can be improved.
Also widget change listener has room for optimisations as it refresh's multiple times if x/y width/height are changed simultaneously
Advanced arrow key movement system, ideally without a game-loop see : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21331519/how-to-get-smooth-animation-with-keypress-event-in-javaf
Undoing and redoing changing an attribute for multiple widgets in one action rather than splitting into individual actions
Change layout to use mvc?
Custom names for hierarchy items (have name as a WidgetGroup property?) When saving will need a separate *.names file
